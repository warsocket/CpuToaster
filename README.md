# CpuToaster
Program to Stress-Test CPU-cooling, Code is tuned to invoke the worst-case thermals.
And with that I really mean worst case. This tool just makles your CPU HOT!, it validates not data or functionality: Its purely intended to test your worst case thermals.

## usage
Just run the executable It will autodetect the amount of cores in you system and then put them all under a load specifically crrafted to make them run hot.
Testing on my own system (sporting a Ryzen 9 5950X) I beat LinPack extrme and OCCT by nearly 10C (66C vs 75C).
